Requirements
Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.6 or higher).

You can download it from the official Python website.
Required Libraries:

pyautogui: For mouse control.

numpy: Useful for numerical operations.

pywin32: For Windows GUI interactions (like getting the window handles).

tkinter: This comes pre-installed with Python, but if itâ€™s not available, install it via your package manager.
You can install the required libraries using pip:

Requirements:
pip install pyautogui numpy pywin32


Minecraft: Ensure that you have Minecraft running, and that you have access to the window you want to control.

Usage
Running the Script:

Save the modified code to a .py file (e.g., minecraft_mouse_control.py).
Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
bash
python minecraft_mouse_control.py
Selecting the Minecraft Window:

Once the GUI opens, select your Minecraft window from the dropdown list. This will ensure that the script controls the correct window.
Starting Mouse Control:

Click the Start button to begin the mouse movement functionality. The mouse will start moving within the Minecraft window based on the defined parameters.
Holding the Left Mouse Button:

Click the Hold Mouse: OFF button to enable the left mouse button hold functionality. The text will change to Hold Mouse: ON.
This action simulates holding the left mouse button down, allowing you to mine continuously.
Pausing and Stopping:

Click Pause to pause the mouse movement. The button will toggle to Resume; click it again to continue.
Click Stop to completely stop the mouse movement and close the program.
Adjusting Parameters:

You can adjust the following parameters in the GUI:
Min Random Delay (s): Minimum time delay before the next mouse movement.
Max Random Delay (s): Maximum time delay before the next mouse movement.
Mouse Movement Range: The range in pixels for mouse movement.
Min Movement Duration (s): The minimum duration for the mouse movement.
Max Movement Duration (s): The maximum duration for the mouse movement.
Additional Notes
Permissions: Ensure that your Python script has the necessary permissions to control the mouse. You might need to run the script as an administrator.
Focus: The Minecraft window should be focused (active) for the mouse movements and clicks to register correctly.
Safety: Be cautious when using automation scripts to avoid unintentional actions in your environment.
